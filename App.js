        <img src={game} class="img"/>
        <li>This game is played on a vertical board wich has seven hollow columns and six rows.</li>
        <li>Each column has a hole in the upper part of the board, where pieces are introduced.</li> 
        <li>There is a window for every square, so that pieces can be seen from both sides.</li>
        <li>In short, itÂ´s a vertical board with 42 windows distributed in 6 rows and 7 columns.</li> 
        <li>Both players have a set of 21 thin pieces (like coins); each of them uses a different colour.</li>
        <li>The board is empty at the start of the game.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Objective</h4>
      <p>The aim for both players is to make a straight line of four own pieces; the line can be vertical, horizontal or diagonal.</p>
      <p>The winner is the first player who gets a straight line made with four own pieces and no gaps between them.</p>
